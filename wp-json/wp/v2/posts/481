Inside was a smaller box with a plastic cover, lined in foam that housed my selfie ring light. (I was very surprised that the packaging was not of better quality considering that it&#8217;s a $48 tech\/electronic item), I thought the packaging cheapened it, by making it look like a stocking stuffer you could just grab off the shelf. I am being super critical only because it&#8217;s one of the requirements here. <iframe loading=\"lazy\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5JmhJu98mek\" width=\"640\"><\/iframe> <\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>As you can see the instructions were basically useless since it was nothing more than a picture of the ring light and a picture of the charging cable and the on\/off button. I was specifically looking to find out how to change the light modes, and there was not a word about that at all, instead I was told not to shine the light into my eyes. I think I probably could have figured that out for myself. What I couldn&#8217;t figure out was how to get it to any of the 5 different lighting modes it promised. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #e06666; font-size: x-large;\">The Test &#8211;<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>. <\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-P_zHvDvrujM\/WHIAuparxQI\/AAAAAAAAJCU\/Ltriv03kB5QBRYXZpiR1qGlyDxIGd6SeACEw\/s1600\/Optimized-selphie%2Blight%2B1.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"a picture of Dyana Aives of inurfacemakeup without the selphie light is dark and shadowy\" border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-P_zHvDvrujM\/WHIAuparxQI\/AAAAAAAAJCU\/Ltriv03kB5QBRYXZpiR1qGlyDxIGd6SeACEw\/s640\/Optimized-selphie%2Blight%2B1.jpg\" title=\"the before picture is dark and shadowy without the light\" width=\"360\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><\/div>\n<p>The item itself is awesome! This little thing, really packs a punch and I was surprised how much light it actually puts out! <\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>It definitely lives up to it&#8217;s promise, by filling in the shadows and evening out the light so that your skin looks smoother! ! <br \/>I couldn&#8217;t believe that something so small could be so powerful? <\/p>\n<p>My biggest disappointment was that it did not in fact, have 5 different modes of light but only two- ON and OFF! <br \/>I am not sure if I just received a defective model, since it took two days of trying to get it to light up in the first place. <br \/>Those things aside, I really loved this item. It&#8217;s lightweight design, makes it super portable to just toss it in a purse or pocket. Since it&#8217;s made of a heavy-duty plastic it didn&#8217;t feel fragile or flimsy, which is good because it didn&#8217;t come with a carrying case. The clip has a spring on it that opens and closes easily so it can fit over your phone even with the case on, but fit securely enough that I wasn&#8217;t worried about it falling off, and can be moved to any area of the phone or tablet.  <br \/>All said, I think this is a great little gadget, with a really good price point, and it would be the perfect gift for the techie\/ blogger\/ selfie fan on your gift list!<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-cbnSHmcgSsw\/WHIAqUkIeiI\/AAAAAAAAJCM\/FtSk-IhbDcIb-rjyIPiOBtN2bTJmPc-DQCEw\/s1600\/Optimized-selphie%2Blight%2B2.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"a picture of dyana aives of inurfacemakeup while using the selphie light, is brighter and skin looks smoother\" border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-cbnSHmcgSsw\/WHIAqUkIeiI\/AAAAAAAAJCM\/FtSk-IhbDcIb-rjyIPiOBtN2bTJmPc-DQCEw\/s640\/Optimized-selphie%2Blight%2B2.jpg\" title=\"and with the selphie light image is smoother and more even \" width=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>**The selfie light was furnished free of charge for my honest opinion in this review.The opinions are my own, and cannot be bought.<br \/>&nbsp;For more info please see my disclaimer page.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was commissioned by Xberts.com to review the ASNAP selfie ring light, unfortunately a glitch in their website prevented me from uploading my review, so(#timewaster) perhaps with any luck, they&#8217;ll see my review here.
