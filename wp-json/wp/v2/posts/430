Instead of piling up all my blankets and pillows (and later dealing with the smell of &#8220;doggie anxiety&#8221; which never comes out in the wash) I could have simply clipped this to the headrests of the front and back seats and had her in her own quilted, waterproof hammock! This snaps right in and out, protects my floor from pet hair and kibble, and most importantly creates a barrier between the front seat and the back preventing her from jumping in the passenger seat to give me directions.
