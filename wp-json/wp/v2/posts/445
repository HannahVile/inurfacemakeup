It seems like no matter how stressful the day, there is nothing like a hot bath to literally wash all my troubles right down the drain. Nothing could be closer to the truth than when taking a Hammam. For those of you that have never heard the term before, a &#8220;Hammam&#8221; is a Moroccan cleansing ritual, which in America translates to a very hot bath to really relax you and open up your pores. It&#8217;s also the name of the gift set that was given to me to review by Zakia of Morocco. <br \/><iframe loading=\"lazy\" type=\"text\/html\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/Tl0bGzMhaxc?rel=0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<p>The benefits of visiting a hammam, sauna or steam room.<\/p>\n<p>Physical and emotional detox.
