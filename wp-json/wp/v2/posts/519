As a kid I remember saving my allowance &#038; buying my first bottle of foundation (accompanied with a grape roll-on lip gloss!) at probably age 10, it was Covergirl and it smelled vaguely similar to Noxema. Now that I&#8217;m all grown up, it&#8217;s part of my job to use only the best foundations, so I was actually pleasantly surprised at how Covergirl has grown up as well. Gone is the smell of Noxema, and it&#8217;s a lot creamier than I remember! Maybe it&#8217;s the Olay influence but this foundation is pretty awesome, it glides on and dries to almost a powder finish, and actually stays pretty well all day. The pressed powder was nice, not as refined (or triple-milled)as I normally like but it&#8217;s also not $55, this stuff retails for about $13.99. So for those of you that can&#8217;t (or refuse) to afford my favorite $62 bottle of foundation, give this one a try&#8230;.I think you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised too!  <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-FVIs0PdZjOo\/UHMusrc3rMI\/AAAAAAAAAdw\/pY_j8Tk5V2Y\/s1600\/covergirl.jpg\" style=\"\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" width=\"272\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-FVIs0PdZjOo\/UHMusrc3rMI\/AAAAAAAAAdw\/pY_j8Tk5V2Y\/s320\/covergirl.jpg\" \/><\/a> *This was not a paid post.
