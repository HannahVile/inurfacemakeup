This is something that I\u2019ve had to endure recently and it kills me.<br \/>My 10 year old golden\/ lab, Dita Von Dog, who has been my sidekick through all my adventures and all my road trips has the beginning stages of arthritis.<br \/>I noticed when I came back from Austin that she had been limping around and it\u2019s really painful for her in the morning and at night (just like anyone else with arthritis.)<br \/>So like any other good mom that doesn\u2019t want to see her baby in pain, I went on the prowl to find her some relief. I don\u2019t want to put her on prednisone (I had to wean her off it last time she went to the vet) so I searched for something less invasive.<br \/>What I found that really seemed to check all the boxes were these &nbsp;&#8220;glucosamine chews &#8221; from Ruff Hero. Here\u2019s why:<br \/>Glucosamine \u2013 vet-recommended to ease inflammatory pain<br \/>Chondroitin \u2013 widely used to repair cartilage &amp; alleviate joint aches<br \/>Organic Turmeric (Curcumin) \u2013 believed to fight harmful free radicals &amp; painful inflammation<br \/>Organic Hemp Seed Meal \u2013 may help calm your pooch while soothing away aches &amp; pains<br \/>Organic Black Pepper Extract \u2013 designed to help boost absorption &amp; bioavailability, so all other ingredients can work together better<\/p>\n<p>Plus they\u2019re in a soft chew, so I\u2019m not crushing up pills and sneaking it into her food. Also it\u2019s not just one of the best sounding ones but also not too hard on the wallet because you get about 120 chews for $29.99 ( that\u2019s about 2-3 months worth depending on how much your dog weighs).<br \/>She\u2019s been on them about a month and a half and I can see a big difference already.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/inurfacemakeup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/A6769584-CC00-4E8B-AB54-DF134870AF7D.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"320\" src=\"https:\/\/inurfacemakeup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/A6769584-CC00-4E8B-AB54-DF134870AF7D-300x300.jpeg\" width=\"320\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>It made me wonder if all of these were created equal ( I can tell you that this one was leaps and bounds better than the last one I tried!) and since I think you should know the good ones from the bad, I\u2019ll be trying more and reporting the results.
