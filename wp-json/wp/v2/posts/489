It&#8217;s about how many people you can reach and engage with to get your message heard. After all, isn&#8217;t that the reason brands wanted influencers instead of ad agencies? We make getting your message out more personal, like having a conversation with a trusted friend. You want someone the people can relate to, someone &#8220;just like them&#8221;, not some big corporation talking at them, but someone on their level talking to them instead. Well, the same holds true now, for those big name influencers who have reached &#8220;celebrity&#8221; status (I&#8217;m not naming names) you cutie-pies know who I&#8217;m talking about, (LOL) but they no longer speak for the &#8220;Everyman&#8221; when they&#8217;re making 7.4 million per year in revenue! They don&#8217;t sound like a trusted friend any longer either, because they aren&#8217;t telling you a secret about a product they found that works, they are telling you about their biggest earner, their cash cow. They&#8217;ve, in essence, become an ad exec.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">So for all you influencers on your way up, don&#8217;t get discouraged if your numbers are not in the thousands, in fact, rejoice, and embrace your smaller more intimate audience, you just became the new &#8220;thing&#8221; !&nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-xonA4IPk7_c\/V9WjL4kvuoI\/AAAAAAAAHsk\/skkXWKtSkNQ\/s640\/blogger-image-960531079.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-xonA4IPk7_c\/V9WjL4kvuoI\/AAAAAAAAHsk\/skkXWKtSkNQ\/s640\/blogger-image-960531079.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-zvdMOU8uwCc\/V9WjK-nxdDI\/AAAAAAAAHsg\/sopO09V7LhM\/s640\/blogger-image--420081842.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-zvdMOU8uwCc\/V9WjK-nxdDI\/AAAAAAAAHsg\/sopO09V7LhM\/s640\/blogger-image--420081842.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While reading this article, today on Tap Influence -&#8220;WTF is influencer marketing?&#8221;, I was surprised to find that studies show, that it&#8217;s not necessarily about how big your numbers are any longer, in the world of influencer marketing.
